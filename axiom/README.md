# Axiom Setup

Axiom is hosted log aggregation tool, which has support for querying, creating dashboards and sending notifications. It also has a fairly permissive free tier.

## Installation

Axiom is a hosted product, so no installation is required. The following steps will allow you to start ingesting logs:

1. Sign up at [https://axiom.co/](https://axiom.co/).
1. Create a new dataset. The name will be used to configure Vector.
1. Create a new API key. The key will be used to configure Vector.

## Configuration

Once you have logs available in Axiom you can then configure Axiom to the configuration you desire.

> [!NOTE]
> Example configuration will be added soon
